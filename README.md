Case-Based Modeling (CBM) is an AI/ML approach that solves new problems by reusing solutions from previously solved similar problems (cases).

This project demonstrates Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) techniques applied to machine learning tasks. It uses a repository of past cases, similarity measures, and retrieval/adaptation strategies to predict outcomes for new cases.
